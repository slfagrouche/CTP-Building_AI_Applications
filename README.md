- **Pipeline.py**  
  Shows usage of different pipelines for sentiment analysis, text generation, and zero-shot classification.

- **Summarization_model.py**  
  Uses a summarization pipeline with Facebook’s BART model to shorten provided text.

- **Tokenizer&Model.py**  
  Demonstrates loading pretrained models and tokenizers, performing sentiment analysis, and working with tokenization details.

- **tensorflow.py**  
  Combines Hugging Face models with PyTorch for sentiment classification, including saving and loading models.
